    <title>MVC: Model View Controller</title>
</head>

<body>
    <header>
        The model is the data. In this todo application, that'll be the actual todos, and the methods that will add,
        edit, or delete them.

        The view is how the data is displayed. In this todo application, that will be the rendered HTML in the DOM and
        CSS.

        The controller connects the model and the view. It takes user input, such as clicking or typing, and handles
        callbacks for user interactions.

        The model never touches the view. The view never touches the model. The controller connects them.
